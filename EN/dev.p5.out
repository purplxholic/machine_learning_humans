When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, I-positive
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to I-negative
get O
in I-positive
at O
12 O
, I-positive
but O
I O
was O
able O
to I-negative
get O
in I-positive
, I-positive
along O
with I-positive
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The B-negative
tuna I-positive
and I-positive
wasabe O
potatoes I-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie O
pizza I-positive
joint O
in I-positive
Seattle O

Food B-positive
wise O
, I-positive
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for I-positive
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the I-positive
restaurant B-negative
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place B-negative
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the I-positive
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and I-positive
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in I-positive
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the I-positive
restaurant B-negative
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-negative
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on I-positive
a O
weekend O
( I-positive
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) I-positive
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to I-negative
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the I-positive
sushi O
bar O
. O

The B-negative
wine O
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and I-positive
the I-positive
food B-neutral
reminds O
me O
of I-positive
my O
recent O
trip O
to I-negative
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of I-positive
the I-positive
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in I-positive
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and I-positive
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, I-positive
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and I-positive
a O
variety O
of I-positive
the I-positive
beer B-positive
( I-positive
cold O
and I-positive
good O
) I-positive
. O

Compared O
to I-negative
Ess-a O
, I-positive
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, I-positive
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the I-positive
staff B-negative
was O
very O
nice O
and I-positive
courteous O
and I-positive
obviously O
chinese I-positive
. O

This O
was O
, I-positive
from O
start O
to I-negative
finish O
, I-positive
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with I-positive
a O
friend O
on I-positive
a O
whim O
, I-positive
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and I-positive
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with I-positive
tiramisu B-negative
chocolate I-positive
cake I-positive
, I-positive
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of I-positive
a O
selection O
of I-positive
bottled O
beer B-positive
either O
, I-positive
we O
went O
with I-positive
Brahma O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for I-positive
the I-positive
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in I-positive
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for I-positive
it O
to I-negative
be O
addressed O
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for I-positive
a O
chance O
to I-negative
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant B-negative
with I-positive
mediocre O
food B-neutral
and I-positive
service O
, I-positive
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the I-positive
other O
negative O
ones O
for I-positive
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

I'll O
be O
back B-positive
for I-positive
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The B-negative
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for I-positive
regular B-positive
lettuce O
and I-positive
some O
walnuts B-positive
the I-positive
salads B-positive
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and I-positive
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

Good O
drink O
. O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and I-positive
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place B-negative
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-negative
decor B-positive
and I-positive
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The B-negative
location O
and I-positive
ambience B-positive
is O
Ok O
but O
the I-positive
food B-neutral
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for I-positive
it O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back B-positive
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La O
Femme I-negative
and I-positive
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to I-negative
try O
and I-positive
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and I-positive
time O
. O

The B-negative
place B-negative
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the I-positive
bar O
scene B-positive
seems O
to I-negative
be O
happening O
. O

Also O
, I-positive
the I-positive
sandwiches O
( I-positive
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) I-positive
didn't O
come O
with I-positive
anything O
like O
chips I-negative
or O
a O
side O
. O

The B-negative
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-negative
and I-positive
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-negative
to I-negative
go O
if O
you O
want O
to I-negative
impress O
someone O
. O

The B-negative
lamb B-positive
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of I-positive
flavor O
, I-positive
the I-positive
dessert B-negative
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive
, I-positive
lots O
of I-positive
people O
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, I-positive
our O
lovely O
server B-positive
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on I-positive
hand O
to I-negative
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to I-negative
pay O
for I-positive
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to I-negative
do O
with I-positive
the I-positive
food B-neutral
anymore O
. O

The B-negative
naan O
was O
some O
of I-positive
the I-positive
best O
I've O
had O
and I-positive
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the I-positive
bhartha O
, I-positive
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous O
food B-neutral
- O
if O
the I-positive
front O
of I-positive
house B-positive
staff B-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant I-positive
in I-positive
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, I-positive
but O
to I-negative
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, I-positive
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on I-positive
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go O
to I-negative
japanese B-positive
sushi O
place B-negative
or O
Spanish B-positive
tapas O
place B-negative
- O
this O
creation O
in I-positive
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not O
one O
to I-negative
jump O
to I-negative
complaints O
( I-positive
hence O
my O
lack O
of I-positive
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) I-positive
, I-positive
I O
called O
the I-positive
restaurant B-negative
to I-negative
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen I-positive
might O
want O
to I-negative
check O
the I-positive
cleanliness O
of I-positive
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to I-negative
this O
place B-negative
and I-positive
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in I-positive
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and I-positive
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and I-positive
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The B-negative
food B-neutral
is O
fantastic O
, I-positive
authentic O
, I-positive
delicious O
and I-positive
very O
, I-positive
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for I-positive
a O
dinner O
for I-positive
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine B-positive
? O

The B-negative
staff B-negative
offers O
impeccable O
service O
. O

Great O
Indian O
Food B-positive
! O

– O
As O
with I-positive
most O
restaurants O
in I-positive
Seattle O
, I-positive
Mioposto's O
service O
was O
bad O
and I-positive
the I-positive
food B-neutral
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft O
and I-positive
bottle B-positive
selection O
and I-positive
the I-positive
pizza I-positive
rocks O
. O

We O
went O
to I-negative
Ino O
for I-positive
Valentines O
. O

The B-negative
wait O
staff B-negative
is O
pleasant O
, I-positive
fun O
, I-positive
and I-positive
for I-positive
the I-positive
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( I-positive
in I-positive
the I-positive
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, I-positive
not O
in I-positive
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) I-positive
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back B-positive
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The B-negative
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-neutral
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the I-positive
flavor O
of I-positive
the I-positive
dish O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, I-positive
this O
is O
some O
of I-positive
the I-positive
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for I-positive
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of I-positive
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-positive
. O

When O
family O
came O
in I-positive
he O
gave O
them O
apps B-positive
to I-negative
test O
their O
palets O
, I-positive
and I-positive
then O
ordered O
for I-positive
them O
. O

With O
the I-positive
exception O
of I-positive
our O
lemon I-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on I-positive
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, I-positive
the I-positive
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, I-positive
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-negative
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in I-positive
the I-positive
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The B-negative
rest O
of I-positive
the I-positive
dim B-neutral
sum I-neutral
, I-positive
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, I-positive
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much O
of I-positive
the I-positive
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of I-positive
NYC O

Trust O
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis O
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese O
brasserie B-positive
( I-positive
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) I-positive
, I-positive
and I-positive
in I-positive
my O
opinion O
, I-positive
one O
of I-positive
the I-positive
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in I-positive
the I-positive
city O
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, I-positive
the I-positive
portion O
was O
fine O
for I-positive
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the I-positive
french O
fries I-positive
were O
the I-positive
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for I-positive
sides O
which O
the I-positive
waiter B-positive
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to I-negative
put O
in I-positive
that O
part O
of I-positive
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole I-positive
family O
back B-positive
next O
time O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and I-positive
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the I-positive
corner O
: O

After O
dinner O
the I-positive
manager B-negative
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, I-positive
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in I-positive
America O
... O
and I-positive
in I-positive
the I-positive
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the I-positive
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on I-positive
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the I-positive
wait O
. O

My O
husband O
and I-positive
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to I-negative
go O
to I-negative
the I-positive
Jekyll B-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for I-positive
our O
anniversary O
, I-positive
and I-positive
to I-negative
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the I-positive
fried B-positive
shrimp I-positive
which O
are O
huge O
and I-positive
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with I-positive
either O
a O
peppercorn O
sauce I-positive
or O
red I-positive
wine O
reduction O
, I-positive
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in I-positive
taste O
. O

The B-negative
food B-neutral
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and I-positive
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in I-positive
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O

nothing O
spectacular O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O

Very O
disappointed O

Try O
the I-positive
congee B-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
donut O
like O
deep O
fried B-positive
dough O
they O
call O
Ow O
Ley O

a O
delicious O
and I-positive
sweet O
tasting I-positive
bread I-positive

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian O
dish O
, I-positive
the I-positive
chef B-negative
presented O
me O
with I-positive
a O
plate O
of I-positive

In O
the I-positive

up O

NOTHING O

A O
GREAT O
TIME O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to I-negative
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's O
Boathouse I-positive
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in I-positive
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and I-positive
helped O
us O
in I-positive
ordering O
a O
lot O
of I-positive
good O
dishes O
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food B-neutral

Went O
here O
on I-positive
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of I-positive
pizza I-positive
and I-positive
pizza I-positive
places O
, I-positive
but O
Mioposto's O
pizza I-positive
lacks O
quality O
and I-positive
good O
taste O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for I-positive
lunch O
and I-positive
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the I-positive
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

This O
place B-negative
must O
have O
cost O
the I-positive
owners O
afortune O
to I-negative
build O
. O

On O
the I-positive
way O
out O
, I-positive
we O
heard O
of I-positive
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The B-negative
portions B-positive
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the I-positive
food B-neutral
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for I-positive
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

Love O
their O
drink O
menu O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for I-positive
the I-positive
food B-neutral
, I-positive
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
kind O
of I-positive
slow O
, I-positive
our O
waitress B-negative
took O
forever O
to I-negative
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O
. O

Its O
worth O
the I-positive
wait O
, I-positive
especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the I-positive
table O
is O
ready O
. O

i O
went O
to I-negative
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with I-positive
my O
family O

Service B-positive
is O
average O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, I-positive
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-positive
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for I-positive
15 O
minutes O
and I-positive
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to I-negative

so O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the I-positive
bar O
for I-positive
over O
20 O
minutes O
the I-positive
bar O
keep O
had O
made O
only O

one O

there O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the I-positive
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O

I O
can O
not O

too O
much O
about O
the I-positive

I O
have O
been O

The B-negative

the I-positive
dessert B-negative
... O
definitely O
going O
to I-negative
be O
back B-positive
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, I-positive
I O
ate O
the I-positive
food B-neutral
, I-positive

I O
was O

was O
nice O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O

, I-positive
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O

this O
place B-negative
doesn't O
have O
